## Overview

### The challenge

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html

```

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik:wght@400;500;700&display=swap');

hr {
  min-height: 80px;
  max-height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  border-left: 1px solid rgb(156 163 175 / 0.5);
}
```

```js
;[
  ['IP ADDRESS', ip],
  ['LOCATION', location],
  ['TIMEZONE', timezone],
  ['ISP', isp],
].map(([title, value], index) => {
  return (
    <>
      <li key={index}>
        <span className="font-bold text-[10px] text-[hsl(0,0%,59%)] text-center md:text-left">
          {title}
        </span>
        <p className="font-bold text-lg md:text-2xl">{value}</p>
      </li>
      {width > 768 ? index < 3 ? <hr /> : null : null}
    </>
  )
})
```

### Continued development

- Deep learning in leaflet library and integrate in NextJS in the future with more functionalities

### Useful resources
